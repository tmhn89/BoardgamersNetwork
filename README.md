Repository for the project of "Design of WWW Services" course
Testing some new things


Some git commands:

1. Get new updates (pull)
git pull origin <branch-name>

2. Push updates to server:
git status -> check what I fixed
git add . -> add all the new modified file to the "stage"
git commit -m "Your message" -> commit the changes to local repository
git push origin master -> push the new code to online repository


(NOTES: Pulling code before modifying files & pushing to avoid error)
